# **Identification of Bottleneck Genes (Master Regulators) in Alzheimer's Disease Using Systems Biology Approaches**

## **Project Overview**

This project leverages systems biology tools to identify and rank key bottleneck genes, specifically transcription factors, acting as master regulators (MRs) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). By applying **ARACNe (Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks)** and **VIPER (Virtual Inference of Protein Activity by Enriched Regulon analysis)**, we constructed gene regulatory networks and inferred protein activity levels from RNA-seq data.

## **Problem Statement**

Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Despite identifying numerous associated genes, understanding how these genes interact within regulatory networks remains a challenge. The goal of this project is to:

1. Identify transcription factors that serve as master regulators in AD.
2. Construct and analyze gene regulatory networks to uncover regulatory bottlenecks.
3. Infer protein activity levels and identify potential therapeutic targets.

## **Project Workflow**

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

- **Download Data:** Gene expression data in star counts format from GEO (GSE153873).
- **Log10 TPM Transformation:** Normalize the data by transforming it into TPM values.
- **Z-Score Standardization:** Standardize gene expression values for comparability.

### 2. **Gene Length Extraction**

- Extracted gene lengths from the **Ensembl BioMart** database to facilitate TPM calculation.

### 3. **Gene Regulatory Network Construction (ARACNe-AP)**

- **Steps:**
  1. Calculate mutual information (MI) between transcription factors and target genes.
  2. Perform 100 bootstrap iterations for robustness.
  3. Apply Data Processing Inequality (DPI) to remove indirect interactions.
  4. Generate a final network file.

### 4. **Network Visualization (Cytoscape)**

- Visualize the ARACNe-constructed network.
- Perform **betweenness centrality** analysis to identify key bottleneck genes.

### 5. **Protein Activity Inference (VIPER)**

- **Input:** Z-score transformed gene expression data and ARACNe network.
- **Output:** Protein activity scores for transcription factors.
- Visualize results as heatmaps for top regulators.
